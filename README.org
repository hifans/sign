* OpenObject sign module
  This repository contains a module for OpenObject/OpenERP 7.x series
  which allows registration of (legislative) signs. The signs can then
  be used in reports, such as labels and material safety data sheets
  (MSDS).

  This module implements signs and pictorgram handling. Typical usage
  is to link other objects, such as products to this module and refer
  to the set of signs stored in the database.

  Signs can be assigned to categories, like with partners in
  OpenERP. Each sign is also given a type, referring to its intent
  (prohibition, mandatory, danger etc.)
